# todo-with-search
This is a concise and functional JavaScript application designed to allow users to add, delete, and search through a to-do list. This project demonstrates the practical use of higher-order array methods, making it an ideal learning resource for beginner developers. While the focus has been on functionality over aesthetics (with minimal styling), it provides a great starting point for those interested in enhancing the user interface with their own CSS designs. Feel free to use and adapt this project as you see fit - no attributions necessary. Enhance your coding skills and let your creativity shine!
